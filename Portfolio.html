			<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>I have been looking for a new challenge for quite some time. The Rutgers Bootcamp seems to be it. I wanted to transition into a new industry and I am so lucky to have found coding. I love it since I tried it the first time.</p>
			<h3>Hopes and dreams</h3>
				<p>Hopefully, my tribe is here to stay. Here in Princeton, New Jersey. Only time will tell if this is only wishful thinking.</p>
			<h3>Roots and branches</h3>
				<p> I come from Southeast Europe. From Macedonia. I've travelled a little bit in Europe... Germany, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, and Serbia. Just a tiny bit in the US... Florida, Texas, Kansas.. Couple road trips from Oklahoma to New Jersey... </p>
				<p>Some of my best friends are also nomads. They roam in Spain, Sweden, Macedonia, the Netherlands, and the UK. Some in Oklahoma, Texas, California, Kentucky, and Kansas. I wish we could see each other more often. But life gets busy and there are so many excuses. But I deeply believe that we deeply love each other and miss each other.</p>
				<p>Living in Oklahoma from 2007-2014 was quite the experience. Met people that I will miss forever. Mentors, friends, colleagues.</p>				
					<ul>
						<li>I love to travel and discover gems of nature or society. I love the Emerald Coast and its beautiful creatures. The ocean, the swamp, the desert. The East Coast, its heritage and the mountains.</li> 
						<li>Living in Princeton, NJ is similar to living in Skopje, Macedonia</li>
						<li>Close to both ocean and mauntain; half-way between New York City and Philadelphia. Marked by the many crossroads...</li>
					<li>Skopje - my birth place, has been known as an important route from Europe to the Middle East; an ultimate crossroad of people and trades.</li>
					<li>But unlike Princeton, I am completely biased to Skopje. The city that I carry in my heart; the place that I don't visit nearly as much as I want to or as much as my soul yearns.</li>
					</ul>
				<h4>Favorite sandwich</h4>
				<p>Here are the steps of making my favorite sandwich.</p>
					<ol>
					<li>Slice freshly baked multi-grain, multi-seed bread into almost transparent pieces</li>
					<li>Spread soft butter on one slice and homemade mayo on the other</li>
					<li>Layer smoked gouda, tomatoes, and canadian bacon</li>
					<li>Finaly, add something green: lettuce, or shredded cabbage</li>
					<li>VOILA! Eat up! Unless you're gluten intolerant, vegetarian or vegan... Then you're probably disgusted and won't talk to me.</li>
					</ol>

				<h4>Musicians and bands</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Led Zeppelin</li>
					<li>Ayo</li>
					<li>Tose Proevski</li>
					<li>Caro Emerald</li>
					<li>Duffy</li>
				</ul>
